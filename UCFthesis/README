This class is designed to replace the ucfthes class, which is based upon an older thesis class that uses a significant amount of plain TeX to meet its formatting requirements.

Design Goals:
1. Separate logical formatting from layout details
The user's documents will not need to contain formatting details.

2. Use LaTeX commands, not plain TeX

3. Use standard packages to meet formatting requirements

4. Be as consistent as possible with the latest LaTeX standards
